TechCrunch is an American online newspaper focusing on high tech and startup companies. 
It was founded in June 2005 by Archimedes Ventures, led by partners Michael Arrington and Keith Teare.
In 2010, AOL acquired the company for approximately $25 million. 
Following the 2015 acquisition of AOL and Yahoo by Verizon, the site was owned by Verizon Media from 2015 through 2021. 
In 2021 Verizon sold its media assets, including AOL, Yahoo, and TechCrunch, to the private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Apollo integrated them into a new entity called Yahoo.
In addition to its news reporting, TechCrunch is also known for its Disrupt conference, an annual technology event hosted in several cities across United States, Europe, and China.

Zack Whittaker Tage Kene-Okafor Brian Heater Jacquelyn Melinek Ingrid Lunden cameraImage Credits: Endel Berlin-based sound wellness company Endel has raised $15 million in Series B funding led by Waverley Capital and True Ventures to further develop its patented technology. The company’s app creates soundscapes that are designed to help people relax, focus and sleep better. The technology takes inputs from the user’s movement, time of day, weather, location and other factors to use AI to generate personalized soundscapes that adapt to changes in real-time. Founded in 2018, Endel has more than 1 million monthly active users and over 1.5 million monthly listening hours. The company says its personalized soundscapes increase focus by 7 times and decrease stress by 3.6 times if used regularly. The app is accessible on iOS, Android, Apple Watch, Amazon Alexa and Apple TV. Since its launch, the company has partnered with several artists to create soundscapes, including Grimes, James Blake, Alan Watts, Miguel and more. “Endel is first and foremost a technology that is built to help you focus, relax and sleep.” Endel co-founder and CEO Oleg Stavitsky told TechCrunch in an interview. “The reason I’m emphasizing technology is because we have built this proprietary patented scientifically validated technology that generates personalized real-time adaptive soundscapes on the spot.” Stavitsky says Endel’s approach draws on several areas of science, including research around circadian rhythms to complement soundscapes with specific aspects about users, such as their location, sex, age and more. The app has several modes designed to help its users with daily tasks. The “relax” mode calms your mind to create feelings of comfort and safety. The “focus” mode boosts your productivity by helping you concentrate for longer. The “sleep” mode soothes you into deep sleep with gentle sounds and the “recovery” mode is designed to lower anxiety. The “study” mode improves concentration and keeps you calm while working. Lastly, the “move” mode boosts performance while walking, hiking and running. Image Credits: Endel Image Credits: Endel Stavitsky says the new funding will be used to further develop the company’s patented technology and to further reduce the time it takes to generate soundscapes. He noted it used to take the company months to generate and create soundscapes and that it now takes Endel sound designers about a week to do so. Stavitsky says his team is looking to bring that process down to days, and eventually hours. The company also plans to continue to produce content with artists and start collaborating with world-known scientists. Endel recently conducted a customer research project and found that it has three main audiences for its app. The first is young professionals who need to get into a state of concentration to complete a series of tasks, whether that’s creating a presentation or sending out a bunch of emails. The second is students, which Stavitsky said is interesting because Endel hasn’t intentionally targeted that demographic. The third major group is frontline workers, such as nurses and doctors, who come home after long shifts and use Endel to fall asleep faster. On top of a 30% uptick in usage amid the pandemic, the company also saw a change in user behavior. Prior to the pandemic, sleep used to be the Endel’s most popular use case, but focus overtook sleep during the pandemic. Stavitsky says the company found that people were using Endel to work and study from home when they were having trouble concentrating. In terms of the future, Stavitsky sees Endel going beyond its current offering and becoming more personalized for users through an “always-on” model. “In three to five years, I believe Endel will be the platform for functional audio. Right now, people go into the app and they browse through a catalog of soundscapes and they choose one and decide what they’re going to listen to right now. This is a very old school consumption pattern. I think what we want to get to is a user opening Endel and seeing just one big play button and you press play and then it automatically sees how many meetings you’ve had today, what your heart rate is like, what the weather is like and then proactively shifts between soundscapes. So it would be an always-on smart soundscape that follows you everyone,” he said. Endel’s Series B funding follows its $5 million Series A investment announced in 2020. Endel has now raised a total of $22.1 million in funding.

 Zack Whittaker Tage Kene-Okafor Brian Heater Jacquelyn Melinek Ingrid Lunden Amazon is finally taking decisive action on its Kuiper communications satellite constellation, securing the rights to as many as 83 launches from United Launch Alliance, Arianespace, and of course Blue Origin. Interestingly, none of the launch vehicles set to be used have flown before — but there’s plenty of time to change that as Amazon’s 3,236-strong constellation takes shape. Announced during the Space Symposium conference in Colorado Springs, the contracts have no fixed value associated with them, and an Amazon representative declined to provide any kind of ballpark. The company said that it has secured, or perhaps pre-ordered, 18 Ariane 6 vehicles (the company’s largest contract ever), 12 New Glenns from Blue Origin, and 38 Vulcan Centaurs from ULA. There is an option to purchase additional New Glenns, and an existing contract for 9 Atlas Vs from ULA. A back-of-napkin calculation puts the lower bound of the value of this new deal at around $10 billion, though of course this is only one part of a much larger operation (and depends heavily on launch costs, which are continually in flux). The estimate simply shows that Amazon is ready to make commitments at the 11-digit scale to get things moving. “Securing launch capacity from multiple providers has been a key part of our strategy from day one,” said Kuiper VP of technology Rajeev Badyal in the Amazon press release. And indeed, they have said as much for some time. “This approach reduces risk associated with launch vehicle stand-downs and supports competitive long-term pricing for Amazon, producing cost savings that we can pass on to our customers. These large, heavy-lift rockets also mean we can deploy more of our constellation with fewer launches, helping simplify our launch and deployment schedule.” Amazon declined to provide any timing or logistical details, but a press event is scheduled for later this morning at Space Symposium. I will update this story with more information if anything substantial is provided on the record. A notable absence from the list of launch providers is SpaceX, a natural enough omission given the intense yet largely unacknowledged rivalry between it and the Bezos-backed Blue Origin. SpaceX launched its Starlink satellites on its own Falcon 9 rockets, and Kuiper and its partners seem eager to show that there are cost-effective alternatives out there. The fact that not one of these launch vehicles has taken a payload to orbit doesn’t seem to have given Amazon much pause. The Ariane 6 is perhaps the closest to launch readiness and is set to fly this year. The Vulcan Centaur may be close behind, but it’s relying on the BE-4 engines from Blue Origin, which have yet to materialize. It’s hard to say when New Glenn will be ready, as Blue Origin has been rather quiet about its development and testing. Amazon did note that it has contracted the Swiss company Beyond Gravity to build the satellite dispensers that will ultimately send Kuiper hardware on its way. The next immediate milestone for the project won’t be a full-scale launch, however, but a small-scale test of prototype satellites to verify the work they’ve been doing on the surface and in simulators. Those will go up late in 2022 aboard ABL Space Systems RS1 rockets. After that, it’s likely that the Atlas Vs will be used first to put the first few batches into orbit and do a bit of a shake out of the deployment and activation process with production satellites. Then the cadence can increase as other launch providers get to flight proven status and come on board.
